<h5 style="text-align: left;">Layer 1 Feature Detectors</h5>

The layer 1 (conv1) kernels are 3x3 feature detectors sensitive to
color, oriented edges, or some combination of the two.  You can
measure the responses of feature detectors by holding up various
stimuli to the camera.<p/>

<b>Color detection:</b>

<ul>
  <li> Use a color palette such as the rainbow figure below to measure
each kernel's reponse to color.<p/>

  <li> Notice that kernel 11, labeled the "Red patch detector", also
responds to violet, because violet is a mixture of blue and red.  How
accurate are the kernel color descriptions?  Test them and see.  <p/>

  <li> Which kernel responds best to light-colored skin?  Which
responds best to dark-colored skin?  Which responds well to lips?<p/>

</ul>

<b>Orientation detection:</b> Some kernels look for horizontal,
vertical, or diagonal edges.  For example, kernel 8 is a horizontal
edge detector that looks for a row of light pixels above a row of dark
pixels.  It doesn't care about color, so the R, G, and B channels of
kernel 8, each of which has a 3x3 pattern of weights, are similar: the
top row has positive weights and the bottom row has negative weights.
If shown a black square on a white background, kernel 8 will respond
strongly to the top edge of the square.  Kernel 4 is a little messier
but is also basically a horizontal edge detector, with roughly
opposite weights to kernel 8.  Kernel 4 will respond strongly to the
bottom edge of the square.<p/>
